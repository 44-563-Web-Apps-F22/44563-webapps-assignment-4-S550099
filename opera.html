        <h3>ACT-II</h3>
        <h4>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
            Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
            occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
            are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
            etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
            degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
            distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
            reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.

                                     In Barataria you may see:
                      A monarchy that's tempered with
                                     Republican Equality.
                      This form of government we find
                      The beau ideal of its kind—
                      A despotism strict combined
                                     With absolute equality!</p></h6>

                                We waited for long,
