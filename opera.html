        <h2>Patience</h2>
        <h4>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
            Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
            occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
            are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
            etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
            degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
            distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
            reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.
CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.
          
                      Of happiness the very pith
                                     In Barataria you may see:
                      A monarchy that's tempered with
                                     Republican Equality.
                      This form of government we find
                      The beau ideal of its kind—
                      A despotism strict combined
                                     With absolute equality!</h4>
                                     FIA.           Though obedience is strong,
                                     Curiosity's stronger—
                                We waited for long,
                                     Till we couldn't wait longer.
               
 VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,
                                     But without your society
                                Existence was slow,
                                     And we wanted variety—
               
BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.
<br>
               
ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
                           From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
                           And to that end we've crossed the main,
                           And don't intend to return again!
               
                 (Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and
                 Giuseppe.)
